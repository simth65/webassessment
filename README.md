JFSD WEB Assessment Batch 5, 31 Mar 2022

1. What did you like about this project?
This assessment is challenging. It reveals what I am lacking and need to improve on. The timing is just nice if I know the technical skills better. It forced me to think of solutions and try out various methods to see if they work.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?
I am confused between padding and margin usage. Sometimes it is also difficult to get Flexbox to work in the way that is desired. I think I have managed to achieve what is needed through trial and error, but I need to strengthen my knowledge in this area to properly master Flexbox. Unfortunately, the webpage I created do not fulfill the requirements 100%, I am not able to get some requirements working as required.

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?
A longer time for this tasks will be helpful. With a longer time I believe I will be able to produce the webpage based on the requirements exactly.
